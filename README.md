# r2modman

## Installing
1. Click "Manual Download" on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Inside the downloaded ZIP file. Run the "r2modman Setup X.X.X.exe" (where X represents the version number).
3. Follow the installer steps.
    - Installing to the Risk of Rain 2 folder will cause problems. DO NOT DO THIS. It's an application, not a mod.

Updates in r2modman are now handled in the background. Leave the manager running for a minute or two, and you'll be notified that an update is ready to install.

If I'm not free, there's a high chance that someone else will be readily available to help!
